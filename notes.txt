 BMI Research in Females

Body Mass Index (BMI) is commonly used to assess weight status,
 yet its accuracy and interpretation vary significantly in females 
 due to differences in body composition, hormonal factors, and metabolic 
 changes across life stages. This study examines BMI specifically in female 
 populations, reviewing how growth patterns, puberty, reproductive health, and 
 aging influence BMI values. Previous research on female rats and women highlights
  that BMI alone does not fully capture variations in fat distribution, particularly 
  visceral fat, which plays a major role in female health risks such as cardiovascular 
  disease and metabolic disorders. The review identifies key gaps, including the lack of 
  standardized BMI cut-offs for females at different ages and insufficient integration of body
fat percentage, hormonal profiles, and lifestyle factors in BMI assessments.
The study concludes that while BMI is a useful screening tool, it should be
complemented with more precise measures to accurately evaluate health in females.
Future research should focus on developing female-specific BMI standards and combining
 BMI with advanced metrics for improved health prediction
